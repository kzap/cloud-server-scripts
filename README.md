This is my collection of useful files, scripts and bits of code for running and managing Linux servers.

Most of these are originally from various sources and I bring them together for what I need that makes sense for my personal uses.

Main goals of this repository is to have more time to do other things than configure servers by hand and debug issues.

Anyone is free to add a Pull Request to improve or add to this library.
